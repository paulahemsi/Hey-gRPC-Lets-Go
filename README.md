# Hey-gRPC-Lets-Go
gRPC implementation using python


>Your next API doesnâ€™t need to be built with REST and JSON. How about gRPC and Protocol Buffers for better performance and structure?


quote from [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/implementing-grpc-server-using-python-9dc42e8daea0) by Martin Heinz

`RPC` = **Remote Procedure Call**

`protobufs` or just `proto` = **Protocol Buffers** = Message format

Protobufs are alternative to JSON or XML, a smaller, simpler and more efficient way of serializing data.

A client application can call methods aveilable on a remote server, it doesn't matter in what language as long as you have *stubs* (generated by gRPC)

To use it, first in necessary to define how the massagens will look in the `.proto` file.

the first line in the file needs to tell we are using the last version os proto, proto3

```proto
syntax = "proto3";
```

the messagens are somehow like enumerators

```proto
message HeyHow {
	int32 count = 1;
	string msg = 2;
}

message LetsGo {
	int32 count = 1;
	string msg = 2;
	string anything = 3;
}
```

We also need to define the services and their rpc methods

```proto
service HeyHowService {
	rpc heyhow (HeyHow) returns (LetsGo) {}
}
```

### Why gRPC over REST?

* better performance
* HTTP/2
* clearly defined and stricter contract

setup

```bash
pip install grpcio
pip install grpcio-tools
```

To generate server and client interfaces:

```bash
python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I./proto --python_out=. --grpc_python_out=. ./proto/hey_how.proto 
```
`-I./proto` path to *.proto* files
`--python_out=. --grpc_python_out=.` where to output the generateds files *_pb2.py* and *_grpc_pb2.py*
`./proto/hey_how.proto` path to *.proto* file (yes, we this and the first one too, actuly the first defines tha path and here we need to write also the file name)

now we have out generates files :

`*_pb2_grpc.py`
`*_pb2.py`


## in *_pb2_grpc.py:

server component will use 

```py
class HeyHowServiceServicer(object):
```

and client component will use

```py
class HeyHowServiceStub(object):
```

this in pb2_grpc.py

```py
def add_HeyHowServiceServicer_to_server(servicer, server):
    rpc_method_handlers = {
            'heyhow': grpc.unary_unary_rpc_method_handler(
                    servicer.heyhow,
                    request_deserializer=hey__how__pb2.HeyHow.FromString,
                    response_serializer=hey__how__pb2.LetsGo.SerializeToString,
            ),
    }
    generic_handler = grpc.method_handlers_generic_handler(
            'HeyHowService', rpc_method_handlers)
    server.add_generic_rpc_handlers((generic_handler,))
```

do the serialization and deserialization that we will use

```
hey_how_pb2_grpc.add_HeyHowServiceServicer_to_server
```


and this

```python
       self.heyhow = channel.unary_unary(
                '/HeyHowService/heyhow',
                request_serializer=hey__how__pb2.HeyHow.SerializeToString,
                response_deserializer=hey__how__pb2.LetsGo.FromString,
                )
```

works in the client

```
response = stub.heyhow()
```
